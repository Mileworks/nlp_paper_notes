Representation Tradeoffs for Hyperbolic Embeddings
Christopher De Sa, Albert Gu, Christopher Ré, Frederic Sala [arxiv](<https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03329>) [code](<https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyperbolics>) 

> Hyperbolic embeddings offer excellent quality with few dimensions when embedding hierarchical data structures like synonym or type hierarchies.

Learning Mixed-Curvature Representations in Product Spaces [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJxeWnCcF7) 

> The quality of the representations achieved by embeddings is determined by how well the geometry of the embedding space matches the structure of the data. Euclidean space has been the workhorse for embeddings; recently hyperbolic and spherical spaces have gained popularity due to their ability to better embed new types of structured data—such as hierarchical data—but most data is not structured so uniformly.
