### submodular function (次模函数)

Submodular functions naturally model notions of coverage, information, representation and diversity. Moreover, several important combinatorial optimization problems occur as special instances of submodular optimization. For example: <br>The set cover problem is a special case of submodular optimization, since the set cover function is submodular. <br>The facility location problem is a special case of submodular functions. The Facility Location function also naturally models coverage and diversity. <br>The determinantal point process model diversity. <br>The Maximum-Marginal-Relevance procedure can also be seen as an instance of submodular optimization. <br>All these important models encouraging coverage, diversity and information are all submodular.
