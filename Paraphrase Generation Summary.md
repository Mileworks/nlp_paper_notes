        The generator, built as a sequence-to-sequence learning model, can produce paraphrases given a sentence. <br>
        The evaluator, constructed as a deep matching model, can judge whether two sentences are paraphrases of each other.<br>
        The generator is first trained by deep learning and then further fine-tuned by reinforcement learning in which the reward is given by the evaluator.
